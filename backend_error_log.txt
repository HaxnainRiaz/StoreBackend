Diagnosis:
The backend server failed to connect to the MongoDB Atlas cluster at 159.41.207.154:27017.
The connection timed out (ETIMEDOUT).

Possible Causes:
1. IP Whitelist: Your current IP address is not whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas Network Access.
2. Firewall: A local firewall or network restriction is blocking outgoing traffic on port 27017.
3. Incorrect URI: The MongoDB URI in .env points to a non-existent or unreachable cluster.

Recommended Fix:
1. Log in to MongoDB Atlas and add your current IP to the whitelist.
2. OR Switch to a local MongoDB instance by updating backend/.env.
